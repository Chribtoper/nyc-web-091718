# One to Many Relationships

## SWBATs

* Implement one object to many objects relationship
  * One object has many objects
  * One object belongs to another object
* Practice passing custom objects as arguments to methods
* Demonstrate Single Source of Truth
* Infer type of method \(class or instance\) through naming conventions

## Outline

* Review yesterday's material
  * we created classes
  * we created instances of classes
  * we created methods to alter the attributes of the class
* self... maybe global
* Dive into today's material

## Deliverables

* Create a User class. The class should have these methods:

  * `#tweets` that returns an array of Tweet instances

* Create a Tweet class. The class should have these methods:

  * `Tweet#user` that returns an instance of the user class
