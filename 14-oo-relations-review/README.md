OO Relations Review
===================

## Topics

- Classes vs Instances
- Variable Scope ( Class, Instance, Local )
- Object Relationships
- Arrays and Array Methods
- Class Methods

## Notes

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

**Remember!** This is a code challenge without tests. You cannot run `rspec` you cannot run `learn`. You'll need to create your own sample instances for testing purposes. Make sure your associations and methods work in the console before submitting.

## Deliverables

We will decide on a domain and deliverables!
